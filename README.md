# Durotar

Welcome to Project Durotar!

This is the n-th attempt to write down all the relevant examples and exercises of the book "Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach", from Kevin Waynes and Robert Sedgewick.

The pourposes are mainly personal (knowledge organization, feeling of completion, and show off), but feel free to use and share everything in here.
